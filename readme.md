Hi,
Thanks for downloading my code.
This python code is a sample for a login screen with a forgot password window and a registration window. 
Python version used : 3.10
Used PyQt5 for GUI Design.
Fonts used: Losing Grip (Make sure to install the font in the zip file)
MySQL is used as the backend.
Before running the code, make sure that MySQL is installed and run the sql_code.sql
Default username and password for logging in is admin and admin.
The forgot password module uses the OTP authentication method to authenticate the user, which sends an otp to the registered mail address.
So make sure that you register with a valid mail address.
Set your email address and your email password (if 2FA is not enabled) or App Password (if 2FA is enabled) as a system variable with the names EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS.
You can either set it by yourself or the code will set it if you haven't.
